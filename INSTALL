Installation is easy. Simply copy the dblite folder in your document root of 
a web server and you're all set.

Dblite has very minimal set of requirements to keep you going.

1. PHP 5.2.6 or higher
2. pdo_mysql (to connect to your databases)
3. pdo_sqlite (dblite internally stores the state info in local sqlite database)
3. Make sure the /data directory is writable by web server.
